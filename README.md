# Snake Client Project

The Snake Client Project is a JavaScript and Node.js-based implementation of the classic game Snake. The objective of the game is to control a snake, maneuvering it to eat pieces of food and grow in length. However, as the snake grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to avoid colliding with the side walls or its own body, as such collisions result in the snake's demise.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
